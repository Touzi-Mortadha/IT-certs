## Compute Services

### Question 1
You plan to deploy a network-intensive application to several Azure virtual machines. You need to recommend a solution that meets the following requirements:
- Minimizes the use of the virtual machine processors to transfer data
- Minimizes network latency

Which virtual machine size and feature should you use?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Virtual machine size:** High performance compute (HPC) Standard_H16r

**Explanation:**
H-series VMs are optimized for network-intensive workloads with high-throughput network interfaces and specialized hardware for data transfer, minimizing CPU overhead.
</details>

---

### Question 2
You need to deploy resources to host a stateless web app in an Azure subscription. The solution must meet the following requirements:
- Provide access to the full .NET framework
- Provide redundancy if an Azure region fails
- Grant administrators access to the operating system to install custom application dependencies

**Solution:** You deploy an Azure virtual machine scale set that uses autoscaling.

Does this meet the goal?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B. No**

**Explanation:** A VM scale set provides redundancy within a single region but doesn't protect against regional failures. For cross-region redundancy, deploy two Azure virtual machines to two Azure regions and create a Traffic Manager profile.
</details>
