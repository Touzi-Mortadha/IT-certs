## Compute Engine & GKE

### Question 1
A company needs to deploy a containerized microservices application that requires automatic scaling, load balancing, and managed infrastructure. The development team wants to focus on application code rather than infrastructure management. Which Google Cloud service should you recommend?

A. Compute Engine with managed instance groups  
B. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)  
C. Cloud Run  
D. App Engine standard environment  

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides managed Kubernetes clusters that handle automatic scaling, load balancing, and infrastructure management while allowing full control over container orchestration. While Cloud Run and App Engine are also managed options, GKE is specifically designed for complex microservices architectures requiring Kubernetes features and flexibility.
